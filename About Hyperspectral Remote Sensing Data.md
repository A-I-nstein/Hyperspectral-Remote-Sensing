# About Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data

## Spectral Remote Sensing

* **Electromagnetic Spectrum** - composed of thousands of bands representing different types of light energy.
* **Spectral** - related to electromagnetic spectrum which includes light that is both visible and invisible to human eyes.
* **Remote Sensing** - measuring the properties of objects without touching them.
* **Imaging Spectrometer** - highly sophisticated camera like sensors used to measure/record reflected light energy from both visible and non-visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Imaging spectrometers (instruments that collect hyperspectral data) break the electromagnetic spectrum into groups of bands that support classification of objects by their spectral properties on the earth's surface.
* **Bands** - groups of wavelengths obtained by dividing the electromagnetic spectrum.
* **Spectral Resolution** - the width and the number of bands together makeup what is called spectral resolution. The spectral resolution of a dataset that has more than one band, refers to the width of each band in the dataset. A band defined as spanning 695-700nm has a width or spatial resolution of 5 nanometers.
* **Full Width Half Max (FWHM)** - relates to the distance in nanometers between the band center and the edge of the band. The band that covers 695-700nm has a FWHM of 5 nm.
* **Higher Spectral Resolution** - more bands that are spectrally more narrow.
* **Lower Spectral Resolution** - fewer bands each of which contains more of the spectrum.
* **Spectral Signature** - the amount of light energy reflected by an object throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. Graphically represented by plotting the amount of energy reflected in a particular wavelength (reflectance - y axis) against the full range of wavelengths that were measured (wavelength(nm) - x axis).
* **Multispectral Remote Sensing Data** - data captured using a imaging spectrometer, which contains multiple (>3) bands of light.
* **Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data** - data captured using a imaging spectrometer, which contains hundreds of bands captured at a very high spectral resolution.

## Trivia

* Different objects can reflect, absorb and transmit light differently.
* A band near the infrared region of the spectrum could include energy from 800-850nm. This band is useful to map healthy vegetation.
* Plants reflect up to sixty percent more light in the near infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum than they do in the green portion of the spectrum.
* The spectral signature of an object can help us identify an object in a photograph created by the imaging spectrometer.
* Often when you work with a multi or hyperspectral dataset, the band information is reported as the center wavelength value. This value represents the center point value of the wavelengths represented in that band. Thus in a band spanning 695-700 nm, the center would be 697.5.

## Remote Sensing  

"Remote sensing is the science (and to some extent, art) of acquiring information about the Earth's surface without actually being in contact with it. This is done by sensing and recording reflected or emitted energy and processing, analyzing, and applying that information." 

## 7 Elements of Remote Sensing

* **Energy Source or Illumination (A)**: The first requirement for remote sensing is to have an energy source to illuminate the target (unless the sensed energy is being emitted by the target). This energy is in the form of electromagnetic radiation. All electromagnetic radiation behaves according to the basics of wave theory. Electromagnetic radiation consists of an electrical field(E) which varies in magnitude in a direction perpendicular to the direction in which the radiation is traveling, and a magnetic field (M) oriented at right angles to the electrical field. Both these fields travel at the speed of light (c). Wavelength and frequency are two characteristics of electromagnetic radiation are particularly important for understanding remote sensing. The wavelength is the length of one wave cycle, which can be measured as the distance between successive wave crests. Frequency refers to the number of cycles of a wave passing a fixed point per unit of time.
